# A Blog

After much cajoling, a good friend, Juannell Riley, finally, and commendably so, made the decision to take the leap from casually sharing his thoughts on centralized social media networks to formally espousing his beliefs through a medium in which he maintained sole ownership of his content. However, after seeing the way in which a motivated but non-technical user was treated in an almost predatory fashion by the standard bargain budget blog hosting platforms, I offered to help set him up with a legitimate blogging engine. Working through that difficult "I like how this looks but it could be better, except I'm not sure how" phase, we settled on a pelican blog with a minimal responsive theme that let his content speak for itself. More importantly, he got to pick up a few new skills (Markdown, git, command line), and I got to enjoy sharing a technical concept with someone who would likely not otherwise gain familiarity with the ins and outs of this whole internet thing. 

I'm currently hosting his site on my own VPS, but as his audience and resource demand grows, will likely move to host his blog elsewhere.
